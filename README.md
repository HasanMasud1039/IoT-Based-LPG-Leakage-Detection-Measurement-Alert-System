Large number of people are using LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) instead of natural gas or other fuel. While using LPG cylinder, there is a risk of leakage of gas, explosion of the cylinder and a great fire. A system is built to detect the gas leakage and make the people alert. This system also measures the gas weight remains in cylinder and sends an alert message when it reaches below 20% to refill the cylinder.
